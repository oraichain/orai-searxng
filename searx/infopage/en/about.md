# About SearXNG

SearXNG is a fork from the well-known [searx] [metasearch engine], aggregating
the results of other {{link('search engines', 'preferences')}} while not
storing information about its users.

* [Weblate]


## Why use it?

* SearXNG may not offer you as personalized results as Google, but it doesn't
  generate a profile about you.

* SearXNG doesn't care about what you search for, never shares anything with a
  third-party, and it can't be used to compromise you.

* SearXNG is free software, the code is 100% open, and you can help to make it
  better.  See more on [SearXNG sources]({{GIT_URL}}).

If you do care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, or otherwise believe
in digital freedom, make SearXNG your default search engine or run it on your
own server!

## The technical details—how does it work?

SearXNG is a [metasearch engine], inspired by the [Seeks project].  It provides
basic privacy by mixing your queries with searches on other platforms without
storing search data. Queries are made using a POST request on every browser
(except Chromium-based browsers).  Therefore, they show up in neither our logs,
nor your URL history. In the case of Chromium-based browser users, there is an
exception: SearXNG uses the search bar to perform GET requests.  SearXNG can be
added to your browser's search bar; moreover, it can be set as the default
search engine.

## How do I set it as the default search engine?

SearXNG supports [OpenSearch].  For more information on changing your default
search engine, see your browser's documentation:

* [Firefox]
* [Microsoft Edge]
* Chromium-based browsers [only add websites that the user navigates to without
  a path.](https://www.chromium.org/tab-to-search)

## Where do I find anonymous usage statistics of this instance?

The {{link('stats page', 'stats')}} contains some useful data about the engines
used.

## How can I make it my own?

SearXNG appreciates your concern regarding logs, so take the code from the
[SearXNG project]({{GIT_URL}}) and run it yourself!

Add your instance to this [list of public
instances]({{get_setting('brand.public_instances')}}) to help other people
reclaim their privacy and make the internet freer.  The more decentralized the
internet is, the more freedom we have!

## Where are the docs & code of this instance?
